He received a patent for the motorcar in 1886, the same year he first publicly drove the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[2]\\\\nHis company Benz & Cie., based in Mannheim, was the world\\\\\\'s first automobile plant and largest of its day.[3] In 1926, it merged with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft to form Daimler-Benz, which produces the Mercedes-Benz among other brands.\\\\n In motorcycles, the most famous boxer engine is found in BMW Motorrad,[25] though the boxer engine design was used in many other models, including Victoria, Harley-Davidson XA, Zündapp, Wooler, Douglas Dragonfly, Ratier, Universal, IMZ-Ural, Dnepr, Gnome et Rhône, Chang Jiang, Marusho, and the Honda Gold Wing.[26]\\\\nAlthough Gottlieb Daimler died in March 1900—and there is no evidence[citation needed] that Benz and Daimler knew each other nor that they knew about each other\\\\\\'s early achievements—eventually, competition with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Stuttgart began to challenge the leadership of Benz & Cie. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, sales, and advertising—marketing their automobile models jointly—although keeping their respective brands.[33]\\\\nOn 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its automobiles as Mercedes-Benz, honoring the most important model of the DMG automobiles, the 1902 Mercedes 35 hp, along with the Benz name.

While pursuing his teaching profession, Bell also began researching methods to transmit several telegraph messages simultaneously over a single wire—a major focus of telegraph innovation at the time and one that ultimately led to Bell’s invention of the telephone.
