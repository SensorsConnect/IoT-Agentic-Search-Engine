Welcome to the official implementation of the **IoT Agentic Search Engine (IoT-ASE)** ‚Äî a cutting-edge, real-time search engine for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. This project bridges the gap between fragmented IoT systems and user-friendly, intelligent access to live sensor data using the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Agentic AI** workflows.

## üöÄ What This Project Does

- Leverages LLMs + RAG to support natural language queries over diverse real-time IoT data streams.
- Implements a multi-agent architecture (GA-RAG) with Classifier, Retriever, Generator, and Reviewer agents for robust, accurate, and context-aware responses.
- Embeds service descriptions using **Sentence-BERT** and stores them in a **HNSW-based Vector Database** for fast semantic search.
- Integrates with MongoDB to manage 37,000+ real-time IoT documents across 500 service types, with geospatial indexing for location-aware results.
- Outperforms generic assistants like Gemini by understanding complex, preference-rich queries and generating actionable, human-like responses.
- Built using modern tools like **LangGraph**, **Tavily API**, **OpenRouteService**, and **VectorDB**, optimized for low-latency applications in smart cities.

## üìä Use Cases

- Find the nearest clinic with the shortest wait time.
- Recommend restaurants with low occupancy and high ratings.
- Suggest the cheapest nearby gas stations in real-time.
- Discover uncrowded parks, events, or retail deals based on IoT streams.

> **Accuracy**: 92% top-1 intent detection for complex user queries  
> **Coverage**: Toronto region with 500 simulated services and 37,000+ IoT data points  
> **Response Time**: 99% of queries processed under 4.12 seconds

Explore the code, adapt it to your region or IoT system, and contribute to making intelligent, responsive cities a reality.


We have deployed this repository on a local machine for testing. You can try our demo using this [URL](https://iot-ase-demo-morning-brook-6041.fly.dev/IoT-ASE-Demo/chat).  

> **Note:** The current demo assumes the user's location is **downtown Toronto**.  
> If you want to query services in another location, make sure to **explicitly specify the location in your query**.  

## üåç Agentic Workflow Overview  

The **IoT-Agentic Search Engine** integrates three intelligent agents to retrieve and process information efficiently:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ IoT-RAG Search Engine  

- Retrieves data mimicking IoT-based information.  
- Hypothetically considers services around downtown Toronto, treating each service location as an IoT device.  
- For example, restaurants in the framework are considered IoT-integrated services, meaning each restaurant is treated as a virtual IoT device.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Google Maps Agent  

- Handles uncovered zones or services by leveraging the **Google Maps API**.  
- If a relevant IoT service is not found in the **IoT-RAG Search Engine**, this agent searches for similar locations using **Google Maps**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scraper Agent  

- Handles general queries or questions that cannot be answered by the other two agents.  
- Extracts relevant information by browsing web content.  

## üìå Available Services  

Currently, the search engine provides recommendations for common **daily activities and services**, including:  

- üõí Grocery stores  
- üè• Walk-in clinics  
- üöó Car rental agencies  
- üå≥ Parks  
- üçΩÔ∏è Restaurants  
- ...and more (primarily places available on **Google Maps**).  

The **Agentic workflow** suggests places based on the following factors:  

- ‚≠ê **Reputation (Ratings)**  
- üöó **Real-time travel time** (using the **OpenRoute API**)  
- üë• **Occupancy data** (scraped from **Google Maps** for crowd analysis)  

## üìù Example Query  

Here's how you can ask the **IoT-Agentic Search Engine** for a service recommendation:  

```plaintext
I want to have dinner with my family at a Middle Eastern restaurant with a good reputation.
```

This query will be processed by the Agentic workflow, and it will return results based on the available IoT data, Google Maps suggestions, and web-scraped information.

üöÄ Feel free to try out our demo and explore the capabilities of the IoT-Agentic Search Engine!
